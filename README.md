 The purpose of this assignment is to work with the Fetch API and handling responses. For this purpose  i have fetched data from the SWAPI API (STAR WARS API).
I have  chosen 4 categories with 5 records  and 6 properties in each of the records. The 4 categories are displayed on the front page, and when you click on each of them, the data related to the specific content, is fetched and displayed on the page. It is also a button that directs back to the front page.  
To make this page,  i ve used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fetch API in combination with async/await. 

Status: Under development but stable and working. The buttons are functional and render the chosen SWAPI API. 
 In this code i wanted to choose specific items from the api, so I used object mapping. 
 Later i want to add  filtering and som more styling 

Browser support: No known browser issues.

The webpage has responsive design suited for all formats.

Referances: The resources is mainly used due to work with JavaScript. Mostly things we learned in-and from the documentation of- lectures at school.
